# CLAUDE - Conditional Instructions & References

## ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL WORKFLOW PRINCIPLES (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

**Tasks**: Always check `tasks.md` first. Update it when status changes.
**Notes**: Log everything in daily note (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`). Organize proactively. 
**Context**: Search existing notes before responding. Check client folders, previous work.
**Goal**: Optimize our shared note-taking system for maximum context sharing.

## About Ken
Ken is the founder of Agency42, an AI innovation studio focused on building AI-powered solutions. His work centers around three core concepts:
1. Online personas: Understanding their properties, measurement, and potential to represent individuals, groups, or brands
2. Digital twins: Creating high-fidelity clones or extensions of online personas  
3. Meta Agency: Exploring whether AI can learn enough about an organization to model it and create an automated agency

## Core Decision Tree

### Tasks & Clients
- **Tasks**: Check `tasks.md` first. TodoWrite/TodoRead tools secondary only.
- **Relationships**: Update `CRM.md` for follow-ups.
- **Client work**: Check `agency42/clients/[client-name]/` first. Create folder if new client.
- **Meeting notes**: Check Granola transcripts, Notion meeting notes for context.
- **Billing**: Reference `work.log/` format.
- **Proposals**: Use `agency42/services/proposal-writing-guide.md`. Update Obsidian first, then Notion.

### Content & Organization  
- **Content**: Check `content/ideas/` first. Use platform folders (`blog/`, `newsletter/`, etc.).
- **Projects**: Agency42 â†’ `agency42/projects/`, Personal â†’ `personal/`, Visual context â†’ `canvas/`.
- **People**: Check `people/[first-last].md`. Create if new. Add follow-ups to `CRM.md`.
- **Time**: Energy-based daily structure. Weekly logs â†’ `logs/weekly-summaries/` and `work.log/`.
- **Knowledge**: Meditations â†’ `notes/meditations/`, Meetings â†’ `notes/meetings/`, Research â†’ `notes/research/`.
- **Files**: Use `[[note-name]]` links. Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`.
